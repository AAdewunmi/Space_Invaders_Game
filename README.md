## 4. Contibuting: 

- I would advice you to open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change with the original creator of the project -> Attreya Bhatt!

- Personally, I plan to propose the following changes to the game:

ðŸ‘‡ ðŸ‘‡ ðŸ‘‡

At the end of the game, once a user presses the space bar, the score is reset to 0 and the game is reset to its original state.
